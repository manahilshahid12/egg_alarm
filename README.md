This is just a simple fun project which I just made out of frustration when I just forgot that I put eggs to boil and when I remembered they were burnt.
So, I developed this small application sort of thingy in which like a timer so that you dont over boil them :) but it is a very fun activity to learn python.
I used tkinter for buildng a simple GUI.
When you run the code it gives you options and you can set your timer.
